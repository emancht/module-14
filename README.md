# Overview

This project focuses on developing a backend server using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to build web and mobile applications. The project also leverages various NPM packages to enhance the functionality, security, and performance of the server.

# Project Structure

The project follows a typical Express.js application structure:

# Installation

To install the necessary dependencies and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/emancht/module-14.git

   ```

2. **Install NPM & NPM packages:**

   ```sh
   npm init -y
   npm i express
   npm i Mongoose
   npm i xpress-validator
   npm i jsonwebtoken
   npm i cors
   npm i cookie-parser
   npm i express-rate-limit
   npm i helmet
   npm i nodemailer
   npm i nodemon
   npm i hpp
   npm i hpp
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   - Create a `index.js` file in the root directory.
   - Add necessary environment variables (e.g., `PORT`, `router`, etc.).

4. **Run the server:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3070`

# NPM Packages

This project uses several NPM packages to extend its functionality:

- **Express.js:** Core framework for building the server.
- **Mongoose:** For MongoDB database interaction (if using MongoDB).
- **express-validator:** For validating and sanitizing user inputs.
- **jsonwebtoken:** For handling JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in authentication.
- **cors:** Middleware to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
- **cookie-parser:**
- **express-rate-limit:**
- **helmet:**
- **nodemailer:**
- **nodemon:**

# Routes and API Endpoints

Here is a basic overview of the main routes:

- **GET /read:** Item Read Successfully
- **POST /create:** Item Created Successfully
- **PUT /update:** Item Updated Successfully
- **DELETE /delete:** Item Deleted Successfully

# Error Handling

Error handling in this application is centralized to ensure consistent responses to the client. All errors are captured and passed to the error-handling middleware, which then formats and sends an appropriate HTTP response.
